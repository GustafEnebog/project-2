# Parametric Wing planform Design App
This App creates a simple top-view drawing of a wing based on parametric user-input such as for example wing span, chord and sweep. This way of designing lends itself better for optimization algorithms and works the other way around to when a designer/user first use CAD/drawing-software to first draw the wing and afterward receive or having to calculate the wing design parameters.

The app is particularly useful for hobbyist designing model airplanes as well as (as more features and parameters are being added) for Aircraft Conceptual Designers since the user immediately receives a live updated graphics to his inputted numbers.

## User Experience (UX)
As a user I want to be able to:

+ Easily determine the purpose of the website.
+ Play around (step up and down or type in form field) with different values of Wing Design Parameters to view...
  + A live updated drawing of the wing planform
  + live updated dependent parameters outputted as they are calculated using the inputted independent parameters.
+ View graphical legend defining the characteristic Wing Design Parameters in the form of a hover over tool tip (also known as screen tips)
+ View legends for variable symbols in the form of hover over tool tip
+ Togle between a default light mode and a dark mode.

## Features
+ The Drawing Area
+ The Input/Output Area
+ Live updating of drawing and calculated output via eventlistener listening to form field inputs
+ Tool tips with nomenclature and symbols
+ Dark mode

+ Alert message for extreme input values

![alert message for delta values above 60 degrees](assets/images/alert-message.jpg)

### Algorithms

1. When an input is made an eventlistener triggers the function 'funcForEvent' which triggers all the functions
2. The input values in function 'calcBHalf', 'calcCRoot' etc. is fetched
3. The function 'deltaAlert' alerts user if user input is extreme
4. The output values in function 'calcLambda', 'calcCSmc' etc. are being calculated
5. The plot coordinates are being calculated in the functions 'calcSweepP1', 'calcSweepP2' etc.
6. 'getDrawingWidth' calculates the drawing width by calling the 'getDrawingSize' function 
7. 'getDrawingHeight' calculates the drawing height
8. The 'getZoomFactor' takes the drawing width and height and calculates how much the drawing coordinates should be scaled so that the drawing and canvas size is the same (see flowchart for this function below).
9. 'getNegXCompFactor'-function calculates how much the drawing should be "moved to the right" in order to not have any negative x-values (out of bounds for canvas).
10. 'compensateNegX'-function apply the negXCompFactor and zoomFactor to the plot coordinates 
The plot coordinates are being ploted in the 'plotOutlineP1C', 'plotOutlineP2C' etc. functions.

Unlike Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) the html element "Canvas" is a bitmap which pixelate when scaled up. For this reason it is very important to scale up the drawing to the same (or larger) size as the canvas size.

The function for determining zoomfactor to keep the drawing within the canvas boundaries (scaling the drawing to be the same size as the canvas) 

![Flow chart for function creating the zoom factor](assets/images/flow-chart.jpg)

As much as it is good practise to keep variables local and to avoid global variables it is sometimes necessary and this code is such an example where relatively many global variables was necessary or the code structure would have had to become very complicated.

### Underlying equations
The following equations define the relations between the different input variables. The first expression represent its most common and direct form followed by other expressions that allows the parameters to be calculated with other sets of parameters.

![parameters equations](assets/images/parameters-equations.jpg)

The following "dependency matrix" shows which variable can be calculated from the other variables in the first column and row and in some cases a third parameter within parantesis.

### Features remaining to be implemented
+ Implementing more parameters, e.g:
  + Aerodynamic Center, AC
  + Neutral Point, n.p.
  + Center of Gravity, c.g.
  + Static Margin, s.m.
  + Horizontal Tail Volume, VH
  + Control Surface Root Chord, csc,r
  + Control Surface Tip Chord, csc,t
  + Control Surface Start, bsc,r
  + Control Surface End, bsc,t
  + Control Surface at LE, TE or in-between
  + etc.
+ Implementing more features, e.g. 
  + Free choice of nr. of wings
  + Free choice of nr. wing panels
+ More display options (toggle with radio buttons):
  + Showing right wing half instead of left as is now the case (write function that multiples y-coordinates with -1 and then subtracts half span)
  + Showing the whole wing, i.e. both left- and right- wing halves (write functions that subtracts half span to left wing half and then add right wing half)
  + Rotate wing into a horizontal position (write function that transposes plot coordiantes or use the [canvas rotate method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/canvas_rotate.asp))
+ Make drawing- (canvas) area adapt (responsive design) to available view port instead of having to resort to a fixed size (currently set to 320px X 569px) 
+ Evaluating if a revision of the code structure and handling of events could allow the number of global variables to be reduced.
+ A 500 ms delay for the tooltips to appear after having been hovered over (no delay for them to disappear)
+ Completing a Dark Mode alternative interface. The button (with javascript-code) to toggle back and forth between the dark- and the default light- mode is already created but has been removed since the feature is not yet fully working.

## Design
The interface is simple and plain with a focus on the relevant aspects, the drawing and the input/output area. The drawing area is at top, (below the breakpoint) and to the left (above the breakpoint) and the opposite for the input/output area.

![wireframe initial idea](assets/images/wireframe-initial-idea.jpg)

interface
Inspiration for this clean minimalistic design came from tools and apps among them monday.com

![Monday.com](assets/images/monday-com.jpg)

The input fields was laid out in a way as to harmonize with the wing planform geometry.

![wireframe input inline](assets/images/wireframe-input-inline.jpg)

![wireframe input stack](assets/images/wireframe-input-stack.jpg)

The usage of tool tips allows the design to be less cluttered yet still having the information easily accessible

![wireframe tool tip](assets/images/wireframe-tool-tip.jpg)

### Colors
+ The lightgrey #d3d3d3 and White color theme provides a color-neutral background setting the stage for potential colorcoding.

![Color example](assets/images/color-example.jpg)

## Features

### The Logo and Favicon
+ The font Nasalization was used for the logo becasue it feels Modern, exciting, and scientific (https://www.dafont.com/nasalization.font)
+ The favicon is made up by the W in the WINGIT-logo.
+ The favicon has been produced in all relevant file formats.

![Favicon](assets/images/favicon.jpg)

### Typography
Noto Sans has been used as a font since it features Greek letters necessary for some of the input/output parameters. "Montserrat" and sans-serif is used as fallback fonts.

## Testing
### Manual testing
+ I have manually tested:
	+ That all output parameters have been calculated correctly
  + the "tool tip on hover" all work.
  + Wrong input type, e.g. strings are not accepted.
  + Responsive design shifts correctly at the breakpoint (width: 576px) between the drawing- and the input-output-area stacked (mobil) and side-by-side (inline) for larger devices
  + The most complex function in the code (cyclomatic complexity rating of 13) can be considered "More complex to understand" and with a "moderate risk to modify" whereas the median function (cyclomatic complexity rating of 5) can be considered as a "Simple procedure to understand" and with a "little risk to modify"

+ Manual testing has been carried out on:
  + Different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari
  + Laptop, tablet (Ipad Air 5) and mobile (Samsung Galaxy A50 and Iphone 11)
  + Responsiveness using the device toolbar in Dev tools

### Validator Testing
+ All code was tested for syntactical errors with perfect results using official validators (Java Script 62 warnings relating to potential compability issues with java script or browser versions):

  + HTML using the W3C-the official validator for html-code (https://validator.w3.org/)

![W3C result](assets/images/wingit-html-validator.jpg)

  + CSS using Jigsaw-the official validator for CSS-code (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

![Jigsaw result](assets/images/wingit-css-validator.jpg)

  + Java Script using the JSHint validator for Java Script-code (https://jshint.com/)

![JSHint result](assets/images/jshint-result.jpg)

  + performance, accessibility, SEO etc. using Lighthouse in Chrome developer tools.

![Lighthouse](assets/images/lighthouse-result.jpg)

  + The low performance score is inherent for a calculation-heavy App and with the live update adding insult to injury.

![Lighthouse reasons for poor 'Best Practices'-score](assets/images/lighthouse-point-of-improvement.jpg)

+ The code was also beautified using GitPods built in beautifyer.

![The first computer Bugs.](assets/images/9th-sept-1947-first-computer-bug-harvard-markII.jpg)

### Bugs
+ Fixed bugs:
  + The most evil and headachy (if that is a word) bug of the project was the drawing overflowing the canvas boundary. The bug fix was to not only set the canvas width="320" height="569" in the CSS-file but also directly in the canvas element in the html-file. The solution came as a result of determining that all the plot coordinates where correct using dev-tools (see below compilation of error elimination). The deceptiveness of this bug was that canvas seem to be working with two different sizes, yet dev tools was showing only one of these.

![unsolved bug drawing overflow of canvas boundaries](assets/images/unsolved-bug-wing-overflow.jpg)

+ Remaining bugs:
  + The drawing coordinates are erroneous () for sweep angle, Î” of 0 which is why this angle is taken out of the allowed input range the sweep angle, Î”. For this reason the negative sweep angle, Î” unfortunately also becomes unavailable despite being in full working order.
  + Below image shows (on the inner wing panel on top) that negative sweep angles is perfectly possible thanks to the getNegXCompFactor function.

### Deployment
+ Go to your GitHub repo and choose the **settings** tab and then **Pages** on the left-hand sidebar and then make sure that the following is set as below:
  + **Sources** is set to â€˜Deploy from Branchâ€™
  + **Main** branch is selected
  + **Folder** is set to / (root)
+ Click save and go back to the **Code** tab and wait a few minutes for the build to finish. Make sure that you do not push to the repo during this time since this will cause the rebuild to fail.
+ Go to the **github-pages** under the **Deployment** section, further down on the right hand side.
+ Now you can see the URL to your deployed site under **Active deployments**. Click on the URL to go to your site. The URL will follow the following format: your-username.github.io/your project name/
